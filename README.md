FLANS-Cards
===========
A flashcard app built with Ruby and Sinatra.
Users must sign up and login to access decks.


###To Do:
* Disable ability to view someone else's profile
* Add more seed decks
* Add navigation to go straight to deck index (maybe home?)
* Potentially add rolling score
* Add placeholder text to each deck (ex: "Translate")
* Fix "Next" and "Score" buttons (reduce padding, etc.)
* Disble autofill for answer box
* Edit/Add/Delete decks (can be as simple as text boxes at first)
* Turn into multiple choice answer
* Use a card's guess stats to make game more difficult (ie round lasts until all are finished, cards are pulled from temp discard pile..)
